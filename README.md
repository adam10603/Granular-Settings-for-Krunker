# Granular Settings for Krunker
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-green.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL%20v2-blue.svg)


## Intro


This extension gives more fine-grain control over mouse sensitivity and FOV settings in [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io/).
The game by default has very coarse control over these, and many people find that they can't fine-tune their settings well enough.


## Installation


[**Download the latest version here**](https://github.com/adam10603/GTAVHandlingParserJs/releases), unzip it, then follow these steps:
  * Open the extensions page
    * [Shortcut for Chrome](chrome://extensions)
    * [Shortcut for Opera](opera://extensions)
  * Enable *Developer mode* on the top right
  * Click *Load unpacked* on the top left
  * Select the *extension* folder from the files you unzipped

The only reason for this instead of it being in the Chrome Web Store is because they require all developers to pay a $5 fee before publishing an extension, even if it's a free one. Fuck that.


## Usage


Once installed, just click the extension's icon in your browser, set your desired values, save them, and go enjoy the game! You only need to set it up once, and from that point, the sliders in Krunker will always be the way you set them, as long as the extension is running.

The extension has been tested to work in **Chrome 72.0** and **Opera 57.0**. It possibly works in other browsers that support Chrome extensions too, but your mileage may vary.
