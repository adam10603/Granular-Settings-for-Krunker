# Granular Settings for Krunker
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-green.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL%20v2-blue.svg)


## Intro


This extension gives more fine-grain control over mouse sensitivity and FOV settings in [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io/).


## Installation


[**Download the latest version here**](https://github.com/adam10603/Granular-Settings-for-Krunker/releases/download/v1.0/Granular-Settings-for-Krunker-v1.0.zip), unzip it, then follow these steps:
  * Open the extensions page
    * [Shortcut for Chrome](chrome://extensions)
    * [Shortcut for Opera](opera://extensions)
  * Enable *Developer mode* on the top right
  * Click *Load unpacked* on the top left
  * Select the *extension* folder from the files you unzipped

The only reason for this instead of it being on the Chrome Web Store is because all devs need to pay a $5 fee before publishing an extension there, even if it's a free one. Fuck that.


## Usage


Once installed, click the extension's icon in your browser, set your values, save them, and go enjoy the game! You only need to set it up once, and your settings will always apply to the game as long as the extension is running.

The extension has been tested in **Chrome 72.0** and **Opera 57.0**.
